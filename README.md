# U.S. Medical Insurance Cost Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project uses a publicly available dataset containing medical insurance cost and demographic information for U.S. individuals.  
The goal is to explore patterns in insurance costs and identify which factors (age, BMI, smoking status, region, etc.) influence the cost of insurance.

The dataset includes attributes like:
- Age  
- Sex  
- Body Mass Index (BMI)  
- Number of children  
- Smoking status  
- Region  
- Insurance charges (cost)  
More about this dataset is widely available on sites like Kaggle. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
