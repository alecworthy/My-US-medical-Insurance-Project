# U.S. Medical Insurance Cost Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project uses a publicly available dataset containing medical insurance cost and demographic information for U.S. individuals.

The dataset includes attributes like:
- Age  
- Sex  
- Body Mass Index (BMI)  
- Number of children  
- Smoking status  
- Region  
- Insurance charges (cost)  
More about this dataset is widely available on sites like Kaggle. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
