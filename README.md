U.S. Medical Insurance Cost Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project analyses U.S. medical insurance data to understand the key factors driving insurance costs. Using demographic and lifestyle variables, the analysis explores how attributes such as age, BMI, smoking status, and region influence insurance charges.

The goal is to transform raw health and demographic data into clear, actionable insights through structured exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualisation.

📁 Dataset Overview

The dataset contains demographic and insurance information for U.S. individuals, including:

Age

Sex

Body Mass Index (BMI)

Number of children

Smoking status

Region

Insurance charges (target variable)

The dataset is well-suited for exploratory analysis and future predictive modelling.

📊 Key Questions Explored

How does insurance cost vary with age?

What impact does smoking have on insurance charges?

Are there meaningful regional differences in insurance costs?

How do BMI and other demographic factors correlate with charges?

🧠 Skills & Tools Demonstrated

Python – data analysis and scripting

Pandas – data cleaning, transformation, and aggregation

Matplotlib & Seaborn – data visualisation

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – identifying trends, patterns, and correlations

Jupyter Notebook – documented, reproducible analysis

🔄 Project Workflow

Data loading and initial inspection

Data cleaning and validation

Exploratory analysis of key variables

Visualisation of trends and distributions

Insight generation and interpretation

📈 Summary of Insights

Smoking status is the strongest driver of insurance cost, with smokers paying significantly higher charges than non-smokers.

Insurance costs increase steadily with age, particularly in older age brackets.

Higher BMI is associated with increased insurance charges.

Regional differences exist, though they are smaller compared to lifestyle-related factors such as smoking.

🚀 Next Steps

Build a regression model to predict insurance charges

Perform feature engineering (e.g. age bands, BMI categories)

Assess model performance and interpret feature importance

Explore fairness and bias across demographic groups
