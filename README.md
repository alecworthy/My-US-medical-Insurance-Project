# U.S. Medical Insurance Cost Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyses U.S. medical insurance data to understand the key factors driving insurance costs. Using demographic and lifestyle variables, the analysis explores how attributes such as age, BMI, smoking status, and region influence insurance charges.

The goal is to transform raw health and demographic data into clear, actionable insights through structured exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualisation.

## 📁 Dataset Overview
The dataset includes attributes like:
- Age  
- Sex  
- Body Mass Index (BMI)  
- Number of children  
- Smoking status  
- Region  
- Insurance charges (cost)  
The dataset is well-suited for exploratory analysis and future predictive modelling.

## 📊 Key Questions Explored

1. How does **insurance cost vary with age**?  
2. Does **smoking status** affect insurance cost?  
3. Are there **regional differences** in insurance charges?  
4. How do BMI and other attributes correlate with cost?

## 📈 Summary of Insights

- Smokers pay **significantly higher** insurance costs than non-smokers.  
- Insurance charges tend to **increase with age and BMI**.  
- People in certain regions showed small but meaningful cost differences.
- Regional differences exist, though they are smaller compared to lifestyle-related factors such as smoking.

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Build a regression model to predict insurance charges
- Perform feature engineering (e.g. age bands, BMI categories)
- Assess model performance and interpret feature importance
- Explore fairness and bias across demographic groups
